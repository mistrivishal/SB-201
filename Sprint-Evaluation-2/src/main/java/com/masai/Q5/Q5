Q5 
a) What is Lazy loading and Eager Loading. Why are they used? Explain with examples.
	
	Lazy loading:- It is related to the object initialization, It is basically initialize 
				   the object whenever it required. 
	
	Ex:-	
	@Lazy		   
	@Service	   
	public class A{
	
	
	}
	
	Eager Loading:- It is pre-loading of the object in at the time of parent object initialization.


b)What is auto-wiring ? What are the ways with which you can configure auto-wiring in spring?

	AutoWiring:-
	  It is the annotation or feature of spring which inject the object dependencies implicitly
	  Internally it uses the setter injection or construction injection
	  
	Ways of AutoWiring:-
	
		"byName":- It uses the injection based on the names, it looks for the bean name matching
				   in the configuration file and its autowired via setter injection.
		
		"byType":- It uses the injection based on the bean object type,
		           if we didn't mention the name implicitly it looks by the type in configuration file
		           and if found it inject the bean;
		           
		"constructor" :- it looks for the constructor with type or non-type arguments
