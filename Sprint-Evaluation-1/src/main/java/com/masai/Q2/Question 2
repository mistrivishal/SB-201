Answer:-
--------
	There are four Stereotype Annotations-
	1. @Component
	2. @Service
	3. @Repository
	4. @Controller
	
	1.@Component:- It is the annotation we used to marks the DAO classes which are commonly use by other classes 
	               and does not part of any layer basically it is the super annotation  of the other annotation 
	               @service, @Repository and @ Controller;
	
	2.@Service:- This the specialize annotation of the component which represent that the class having @service 
				 annotation is belongs to the service layer then it is easy to differentiate the classes into service layer;
				 
	3.@Repository:- This is basically use on the Data-Access Layer which represents that the class belongs to the data access layer
				 	where all the data access logic is written.
				 
	4. @Controller:- The Controller annotation denotes that the current class is controller of this Layer which responsible to handle 
				 	 all the logic in one place/class
