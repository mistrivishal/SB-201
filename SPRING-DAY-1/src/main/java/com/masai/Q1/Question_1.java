//	Q 1. What is Tight coupling and loose coupling?
	
//		Tight coupling :- When the objects are depend upon each other for some functionality is call coupling
//		  				  But when one object is highly depend upon another object class, If we make changes in dependency 
//		  				  class it forced us to make change in the dependent class this dependency cenario is called as
//		  				  the "Tightly Coupled" objects.
//		Loose Coupling :- When the dependencies of the dependent class object is reduce and the it becomes more flexible in 
//						  term of of functionality is the "Loose Coupling".. We can use the setter methods or constructor for the 
//						  accessing the object which makes it very flexible to assign the object variable and does not affects the 
//						  main code.
