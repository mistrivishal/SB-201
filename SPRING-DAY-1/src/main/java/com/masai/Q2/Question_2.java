//		When we want to create dependencies and we take the help of external entity to maintain the 
//		dependencies with simplified manner which is maintain by the IOC container..

//		Object creation and the manages the component of the objects in the "Spring configuration file" which 
//		known as the Spring IOC.
	
//		Need of spring IOC:-
//		1. Using the Spring IOC its makes programming of any java apllication easier and faster

//		   change it in to class the dependencies were not got affected by this which make the JAVA
//		   program flexible.
